## Motivation

[![og](https://github.com/JordanPCF/Minecraft-Diamonds-v2/blob/main/assets/og_video_screenshot.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Icj5TNmBUI&t=160s&ab_channel=MatthewBolan)

In his YouTube video, Matthew Bolan explains how the limitations of Java's random number generator can be exploited to better find diamonds, a coveted resource in Minecraft. He walks through how each world is generated, and the correlation between certain feature's representation in bits. __The result--by venturing to certain biomes and locating the center of clay and gravel patches above ground, one can calculate the number of blocks in the z-direction to move from the patch center to  mine straight down to diamonds.__ 

Bolan warns that this likely only works for the PC version of the game and not Bedrock (for xbox which I play). But because the Bedrock RNG is even worse (only 32 vs 48 bits of state), I decided it was worth creating and exploring a dataset of the diamonds in my world. 



## The App

#### Use
To determine the pattern for the Bedrock version:

1. (In Minecraft) Strip-mine for diamonds below swamps and riverbeds
2. Note the coordinates of the diamond blocks.
3. Return above ground and take note of clay or gravel patches within the same 'rendering chunk' (use [this file](https://github.com/JordanPCF/Minecraft-Diamonds-v2/blob/main/tests/chunkBoundaries.py) to calculate the borders of the chunk).
4. With this app, record:
    - Coordinates of diamond blocks
    - Coordinates of the patch centers
    - Patch type (clay or gravel)
    - Biome (swamp or river)
    - Patch area
    - If the patch was cut off by another landscape feature
    - If the patch spans a border between two 16x16 rendering chunks
5. Check out the data dashboard as you accumulate data to look at the distribution, per biome/patch case, of the number of blocks in the z-direction you should travel from the center of a patch to find diamonds.

#### Map View 

Select your coordinate location on the map to record your mining data and track where you have searched for diamonds.

#### User Data Collection

Interactive 3D map to record diamond data and update the Amazon DynamoDB database. Minecraft worlds are rendered in 16 x 16 vertical 'chunks'. The borders of these chunks are relevant to the spawning of correlated features such as clay/gravel patches and diamond ore.

Users add diamond blocks at the x-z coordinates of known diamond ore and select the blocks to enter data about the corresponding features.

#### Data Dashboard
Based on the biome the user is currently exploring, they can predict how far from a gravel or clay patch's center diamonds are likely to be found. The depth of the diamond ore is believed to be related to the area of the above-ground patch and informs the user on how deep to mine. Clay and gravel patches are often cut off by other land features or near the edge of a rendering chunk's border. It is unclear if the correlation pattern will apply in these cases, so they are all displayed separately here.
